        Scripts to calculate and plot the complex permittivity from S-parameter data acquired with transmission-line measurements
        
        Overview
        --------
        permittivitycalc is a Python package made to take S-parameter data output from METAS VNA Tools II (https://www.metas.ch/metas/en/home/fabe/hochfrequenz/vna-tools.html) and process it to calculate and plot the complex permittivity of a material measured in a coaxial transmission line.
        
        Currently, permittivitycalc uses the New Non-iterative Method for permittivity calculation from S-parameters from [Boughriet1997]_ which assumes that the material is non-magnetic (i.e. \mu = 1).
        
        permittivitycalc can also use the Nicholson-Ross-Weir method to calculate the complex permittivity and permeability of a sample. This method, however, is unstable at multiples of one-half wavelength in the sample [NicolsonRoss1970]_ [Weir1974]_.
        
        You can use permittivitycalc to:
        
        - Input and plot raw S-parameter data in tabular form with or without uncertainties.
        - Calculate and plot the complex permittivity with full propagation of uncertainties.
        - Perform connector de-embedding on the raw S-parameters to extract the sample S-parameters, if necessary. Example: de-embedding washers used to cap the transmission line when measuring powdered samples.
        - Correct for the boundary effect in the transmission line when measuring powdered samples after [Hickson2017]_.
        - Correct for the air gap when measuring solid samples after [Baker-Jarvis1993]_.
        - Plot data from multiple measurements together for comparison.

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        permittivitycalc was written for Python 3 and tested on the following versions of Python:
        
        - 3.6
        
        permittivitycalc uses the following packages:
        
        - tkinter
        - numpy 
        - uncertainties
        - scipy
        - matplotlib
        - seaborn
        - cycler
        
        Installing Anaconda
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        We recommend using `Anaconda`_ to manage your Python environments.
        
        .. _`Anaconda`: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
        
        1. `Install Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_.
        
        2. Open a terminal window and create a `conda virtual environment`_ (name it anything you like, and set the python version to a compatible version in `Requirements`_)::
        
            conda create --name your_env_name python=3.6
        
        3. Activate the environment (on Windows, omit "source")::
        
            source activate your_env_name
        
        .. _`conda virtual environment`: https://conda.io/docs/using/envs
        
        Quick Install
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Install permittivitycalc with pip::
        
        	pip install permittivitycalc
        
        Manual Install
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        1. (Optional) Fork `permittivitycalc on Github <https://github.com/boivinalex/permittivitycalc>`_
        
        2. Clone or download the repository.
        
        3. Navigate to the permittivitycalc root directory and install with::
        
        	python setup.py install
